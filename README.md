Hello ! This is the JPEG recovery tool made for the Problem Set 4 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.
The user should input the key in the command prompt after the ./recover file.raw command (file.raw being the name of the file).

The software works as follows :

1 . Get the users input and checks if it's valid
2 . Buffers the memory card and check if there is valid jpeg files to recover in it
3 . Recovers the JPEG files one by one until the software has finished reading the memory card
